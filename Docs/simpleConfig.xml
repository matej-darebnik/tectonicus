	This sample configuration demonstrates the most commonly used configuration settings.
	It will render a map of the entire Overworld at daytime with all markers shown.

	You only need to change the "worldDir" path below to your Minecraft world folder,
	and the "outputDir" path if desired. Increasing the "closestZoomSize" to "24" or "48" will
	save you disk space, but with less detail available when zoomed all the way in.
	
	See exampleConfig.xml for a sample with more options,
	or fullConfig.xml for all the available settings and their defaults.
